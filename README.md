# todo_list
This is a simpletodo app made to get familiar with Rust 
Based off Brooks CodingGarden tutorial

it works as follows:

cargo run get --> Prints the todo list to the command line

cargo run add "name of item to add to list" --> Add a new todo item

cargo run done "completed item" --> Marks this item as done on the list

cargo run remove "todo item name to remove" --> Removes this todo item from the list
